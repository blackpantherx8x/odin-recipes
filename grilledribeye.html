            <li>Pressed Garlic (because we all love garlic)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by gently scoring the outside of your ribeye, lathering with canola oil and seasoning with salt. 
            Place the ribeyes on a sheet tray and add them to the fridge for 40 minutes. 
            Next, slice your potatoes into fries and place them in a bowl of ice water. Let them soak until you are ready to start cooking.</li>
        <li>Finally, crack your egg into a bowl along with the pressed garlic and lemon juice. 
            Begin whisking vigorously until the mixture begins to thicken. Then, slowly add your olive oil little by little while whisking in order to fully immerse it. O
            nce the consistency has thickened and the oil is fully immersed, add your salt and freshly cracked black pepper. 
            Stir, add to a bowl and place in the fridge until serving.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium high heat (around 375F) for direct grilling.</li>
        <li>Heat up a dutch oven/skillet with Wagyu Beef Tallow from South Chicago Packing until the tallow is 350F. D
            ry off your fries and add them to the beef tallow. Cook the first time for about 3-4 minutes, pulling them out and letting them cool for 2-3 minutes 
            (Note: Do the fries in 2-3 batches so as to not overcrowd the pan). 
            Then, add the fries back to the pan and fry again until they are golden brown (about 4-5 more minutes). 
            Once the fries are done, place them on a plate with a paper towel to catch the excess oil. 
            Add the fries to a bowl along with some salt and toss to evenly coat them. Keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Pull your steak out of the fridge to come to room temperature for about 15 minutes. In another skillet, add your beef tallow and crushed garlic cloves. 
            Let that simmer while you make an herb brush with your rosemary & thyme sprigs. Next, add the steak to the grill and cook until 120F internal 
            (about 15-25 minutes). Cook the steaks for about 3-4 minutes per side until you flip them and baste with the garlic infused beef tallow. 
            Make sure to move the steaks around and avoid flare ups. If you do have flare ups, pull the steak off for 15-20 seconds then add it back and continue cooking. 
            When the steaks are done, let the steaks rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the steaks are rested, slice them off the bones and serve with the fries and garlic peppercorn aioli. Enjoy!</li>
